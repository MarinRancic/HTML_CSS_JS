			<h2>League of Legends</h2>
		</header>
			<p>
				League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre video game developed by Riot Games.
				It was designed to operate on the Microsoft Windows operating system. The game was first announced on October 7, 2008 and released
				a year later on October 27, 2009. The game was in beta from April 10, 2009 to October 26th, 2009.
			</p>
			<h3>Gameplay</h3>
			<p>
				Players are formed into two even teams primarily comprised of five members. Each team starts at opposing sides of a map, near what is
				called a "Nexus". To win a match, a team must destroy the opposing team's Nexus. To do so, each team must work through a series of towers
				called 'turrets' that are placed along three paths to each base (commonly referred to as 'lanes') Along the way, each player gains power by
				completing game objectives, earning them experience points and gold that are used to increase the player's level and to purchase powerful
				items, potentially giving players an advantage over their opponents. Examples of these objectives include killing the opposing team's
				turrets, players, and 'minions' (small NPCs that constantly spawn and attack the other team).
			</p>
			<h3>Matchmaking</h3>
			<p>
				League of Legends is a session-based game. Matchmaking occurs based on the average Elo ratings of each player. The game can be currently
				played in four different modes: normal, Co-op vs. AI, custom, or ranked. In a normal game, the server attempts to match up players of equal skill level.
				It is possible to enter an arranged team of players, in which case the arranged team is considered to be more powerful than the individual players.
				A co-op game requires you to team up with four other randomly selected players to play a five versus five match against a team of five randomly selected bots.
				Custom game allows players to create a session and set its properties, or find an existing session to join. Unlike co-op, custom allows you to
				make any range of teams on either side from one to five. Empty spaces can be filled in by bots or players, or remain empty.
				Ranked games are competitive matches open only to players who have reached level 30. It features a draft mode champion
				selection process, where a handful of champions are banned before picking begins.

				Each player controls a single champion. While the game came out with 40 champions there are currently 155 different champions available
				in the game, each with unique characteristics. Certain champions are tagged with certain attributes such as 'tank', 'fighter', 'mage' or
				'support' to describe their play style. Champions have more than one attribute, and can be played in a variety of ways, though some are
				more viable than others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Champions gain experience by killing enemy minions, neutral monsters, champions, or structures. After reaching a certain amount of experience,
				the champion levels up. Each level increases the champion's stats and adds an ability point that can be spent to improve one of the champion's
				four unique abilities. They also have the ability to level up their ultimate ability at level 6, to a maximum rank of three. The maximum level
				for a champion is 18.

				<h2>E-sports</h2>
			</header>
				<p>
					Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of competition using video games.
					Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually
					or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the
					late 2000s. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and
					providing funding for tournaments and other events.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting,
					card, battle royale and real-time strategy (RTS) games. Popular esport franchises include League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Valorant,
					Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and StarCraft, among many others. Tournaments such as the League of Legends World Championship,
					Dota 2's International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters are among the most popular
					in esports.
